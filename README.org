* org-epubinfo
Org-EpubInfo integrates [[https://github.com/akirak/epubinfo][epubinfo]] program with Emacs Org mode.
At present, it provides a dynamic block for inserting the table of contents
of an EPUB file.
** Installation
This package is not available on MELPA yet.
Install =epubinfo= program and this package.
** Usage
=epub-toc= dynamic block inserts the table of contents of an EPUB file.
See the following example:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+BEGIN: epub-toc :depth 1 :checkbox t
  ,#+END:
#+end_src

The Org entry should contain a =file:= link to the EPUB file.

When you hit =C-c C-c= on this block, an Org list is inserted into the block.
The maximum depth is 1 in this example, so only the chapters are populated.
Since =:checkbox= is set to t, each item has a checkbox.

The output will be as follows:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+BEGIN: epub-toc :context self :depth 1 :checkbox t
